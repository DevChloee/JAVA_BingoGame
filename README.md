# JAVA_BingoGame
JAVA | This is a Bingo Game where the objective is to match identical cards until all cards have been successfully matched, completing the game.



This is a Bingo game implemented using Java's Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) and the Swing GUI toolkit. The code sets up a GUI window with a 4x4 grid of cards that display images of fruits. The goal of the game is to find pairs of matching fruit cards. The game starts with shuffling the cards and the player clicks on two cards to reveal the images.

If the two cards match, the player earns a point and the cards remain open. If the cards do not match, the cards are turned back over after a short time delay. The game continues until the player finds all 8 pairs of matching cards. The code uses a number of classes and interfaces in the Java AWT and Swing packages to create the GUI and implement game logic. The game logic is driven by the actionPerformed method which handles the events generated by clicking on the cards.
